    <p> Of course, there is the possibility that we’re merely overthinking things, given everything fans have been forced to endure in the recent past.

At one point in the trailer, Trinity appears to digitally decompose, which suggests she might be some sort of illusion, or a painful memory that Neo’s mind is attempting to bring to the surface. It’s possible that Neo himself is just a phantom character in a larger story, seeing as how both he and Trinity’s human bodies perished in The Matrix Revolutions. We just don’t know.

That’s of little consolation at this point, however. Hollywood has conditioned diehard pop culture fans on both sides of the political aisle to expect the worst, and alienated them in the process.
